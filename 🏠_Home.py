            <p style="font-size: 3em; float: left; line-height: 0.9;">V</p>odafone seeks to enhance its customer retention strategies by predicting customer churn using machine learning models. 
            This project, leveraging the Streamlit framework, outlines the creation of a data application to deploy predictive models with a user-friendly interface. </br>


            #### Why Model Deployment?
            Incorporating customer churn prediction into Vodafone's strategy is vital. 
            By predicting which customers are likely to leave, Vodafone can implement targeted retention efforts. 
            Deploying these models through Streamlit empowers stakeholders with actionable insights, seamlessly integrating into existing business environments.

            The data cleaning logic and pipeline is in the code base of this page.
            - **Dashboard:** It contains visualizations of the dataset used to train the models. 
            You can select between the 3 different types using a drop down menu. An **EDA** dashboard, an analytics **KPIs** dashboard with filtering capabilities and 
            a **model explainer** dashboard with Confusion matrix, AUC ROC Curves and a feature importances visualization to understand the drivers of customer churn for the leading model.        
            - **Predict:** Contains a list of models in a drop down with corresponding pipelines used to predict customer churn. There are two tabs namely predict and bulk predict for single and bulk prediction(s) respectively. 
            The bulk predict allow users to upload of csv or excel files with same schema as the data used for training and testing. 
            A toggle button allow users to make predictions by way of searching a particular customer or several customers in the predict and bulk predict tabs respectively.  
            - **History:** This page contains table view of the past predictions made including their churn, probability, model used and time stamp.
